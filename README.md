# Brenden Cabrera Intro to Programming Project: Stock Game

## Plan
My goal is make a Stock Game where there is a stock line in the screen that is constantly and randomly going up and down. The user has a starting balance of 10,000 dollars and they can press "BUY" button that will enter them in a trade. Trade meaning that when the stock goes up, they will be making money and if the stock goes down, they will be losing money. The goal is going to be a pre-set amount (Ex: $100,00) and if they reach that they will win, and they will lose if they lose all their money.


## TO-DO
- [x] Show Player balance on the screen
- [x] Add BUY button.
- [x] Make Player class
- [x] Make SELL button, only when user is in trade
- [ ] Make Stock Line.
- [ ] Make function when user enters trade.
- [ ] Make Game Over and Win Screen


## Ideas
- Make button in bottom middle, buy button when not in trade and sell button when in trade
- Have like a "chart" setup for the stock price line, meaning making a section above the button and below the player balance just for the price
- Use image for button instead of pygame rect ??
