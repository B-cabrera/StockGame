# Brenden Cabrera Intro to Programming Project: Stock Game

## Plan
My goal is make a Stock Game where there is a stock line in the screen that is constantly and randomly going up and down. The user has a starting balance of 10,000 dollars and they can press "BUY" button that will enter them in a trade. Trade meaning that when the stock goes up, they will be making money and if the stock goes down, they will be losing money. The goal is going to be a pre-set amount (Ex: $100,00) and if they reach that they will win, and they will lose if they lose all their money.
